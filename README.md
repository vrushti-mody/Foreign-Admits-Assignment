## Technology Stack

##### Technology Stack

- Front End: Angular
- Backend: NodeJs
- Database: MongoDB
- Cors for cross origin settings
- Bcrypt for hashing password
- Passport for authentication
- Google auth for google login
- Express session for user session
- Ejs as the templating engine for Node.js

##### Implementation


* Register Page: The register page is used to register an account into the system. It takes three basic details: name, email, password.

* Login Page: It is used to log in to the system. It checks if the user credentials are valid.

* Login using Google: An option to log in using google is provided if the user does not want to register and directly log in

* Home Page: The home page displays user details. They are incomplete on the first login

* Settings Page: The details of the home page can be updated using the settings page.

* Logout: The logout function destroys a session and redirects the user to login page


##### Validations:

- Valid email
